# Bayesian-Statistics
Predictions using the Bayesian Theory

In this project we follow Bayesian approach and use Logistic Regression Modelling with the assitance of JAGS(Just Another Gibbs Sampler) to run MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and produce posterior distributions with point and interval estimates of each ivdividual based on thier demographic and personal traits. We further extend our model capabilities and test our model on unseen data that is testing data to ensure productivity and provide assurance.
